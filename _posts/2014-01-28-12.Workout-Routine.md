###Topic

Well, I normally work out for about an hour an a half when I go to the gym. I first do some stretching to warm up. Then, I do some cardio on the treadmill for about 30 minutes. After that, I lift some weights to build muscles. That takes about another 30 minutes. Plus. I do sit-ups to work on my abs. After I'm done with all this, I wrap up by riding the stationary bike for about 20 minutes. Overall, I think I burn roughly 700 to 800 calories whenever I work out. After the workout, I go home and hit th shower.
