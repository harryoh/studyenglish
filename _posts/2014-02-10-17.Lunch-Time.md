###Topic

Lunch break is a chance to take a breather from work. I normally spend my lunch break with my co-workers. We often grab a quick bite nearby. There aren't too many options near the office, so we end up going back to he same few restaurants. After having lunch, we typically spend the remaining break at a cafe. We just chat with one another. Of course, there are times when I have to take care of personal matters during lunch break. I run errands such as going to the bank. Overall, I try to get my mind off of work during lunch breaks.
