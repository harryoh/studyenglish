###Topic

I like taking walks. I often go for a walk at a park near my house. It's only a five-minute walk from my home. The park isn't that big. It takes about twenty minutes to go around the park. I do several laps to get enough exercise. I normally walk for about an hour in the evening. It feels great after walking like that. I feel like I'm getting healthier. Many people come to the park to walk just like myself. Some bring their dogs out for a walk. In fact, I run into my neighbors quite often while I'm taking a walk at the park.
