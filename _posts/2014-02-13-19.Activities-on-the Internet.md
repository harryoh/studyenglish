###Topic

As with most people out there, I spend a lot of time on the Internet. I think I log on every day. The most frequent thing I do on the Internet is to use the search engine to search for things. I do searches for practically everything. Also, I check my email, do online banking, and also buy things online. I shop for electronics, food, or even clothes or accessories. I also buy movie tickets on the movie theater websites. It's safe to say that I pretty much do everything on the Internet. Because I can get Internet access on my smartphone, I can do all of this on my phone as well.
