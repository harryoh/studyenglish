###Topic

There are a few problems that arise while you are shopping. First, when you're shopping for clothes, a store may not have your size in stock. You may also not find the style or color you want. If that's the case, you may have to go to another store. However, I think the bigger problem related to shopping is money. Spending too much money is probably the biggest problem when it comes to shopping. To avoid that situation, I often make a list of what I need. I try not to buy things impulsively. I also do my homework online before buying something. That's how I try to be a wise shopper.

###Expression‍ of the day

A : 정말? 항상 그렇게 목록을 작성하니?  
B : 응, 나는 항상 쇼핑 목록을 만들려고 해.
