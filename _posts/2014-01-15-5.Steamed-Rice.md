###Topic

Koreans eat steamed rice all the time. It's our staple food. Every household has a rice cooker. In fact, I cooked rice this morning myself. I first washed the rice with water several times. And then, I set the rice in the rice cooker. I set the menu to cook and pressed the cooking button. After 20 minutes or so, the rice was ready. I opened the rice cooker and stirred the rice. I took a bite and it tasted perfect. I had put exactly the right amount of water in it. I was very happy with how the rice turned out.
