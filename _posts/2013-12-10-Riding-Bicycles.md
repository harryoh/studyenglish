###Topic

I ride bicycles whenever I have the opportunity. There is a riverside park along the Han River in Seoul. I often go there to ride my bike. There is a bicycle path along the river. You don't need to take your own bike. There are places where you can rent bicycles. There are bikes for both kids and adults. There are also tandem bikes for couples. I often go to ride bicycles with friends or family. I enjoy the breeze while I ride bicycles. I think it's a great way to get some exercise as well. I really like that riverside park where I ride bicycles.
