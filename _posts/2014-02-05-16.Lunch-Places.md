###Topic

We have a company cafeteria in our office building. The food is okay and the price is reasonable. I eat there most of the time because it's convenient. They have a set menu every day, so I don't need to think about what to order. On some days though, I go out to eat at restaurants nearby with my colleagues. There are tons of places that serve lunch near our office building. We mostly eat Korean food, but sometimes we have Chinese or Japanese as well. Of course, there are times when I'm really busy or when I don't feel like eating that much. In that case, I just grab a quick sandwich.
