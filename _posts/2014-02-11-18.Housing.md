###Topic

When I was a kid, I remember living in a house with a garden. My family lived there for almost 10 years. My brother and I used to play there all the time. We had grass, we had trees, and we were able to raise dogs outside. But now, I live in and apartment. I live on the twelfth floor. Because we are living with other people, we have to be more considerate of our neighbors. Back in the day when we were living in a house, we didn't really have to do that. That's one of the biggest differences between living in a house and an apartment.

###Expression‍ of the day
