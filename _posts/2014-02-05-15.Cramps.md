###Topic

I remember one time when I had cramps in my foot while I was swimming. I grabbed my foot and tried to make it go away. But it wasn't easy doing that in the water. It was really painful. Fortunately, I wasn't in deep water, so I quickly walked out of the swimming pool. I stretched my leg and shook my foot back and forth, but the cramps kept coming back. Eventually, I got help from the lifeguard. I was so relieved when the cramps went away. It was quite a memorable experience. Ever since that incident, I always warm up thoroughly before I go in the water.
