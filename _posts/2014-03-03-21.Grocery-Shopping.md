###Topic

My family normally goes to a discount store near my house for grocery shopping. The last time we went was several days ago. We bought rice, some meat, some fruit, and some snacks. We also bought a bottle of wine and some other beverages. It was a typical grocery shopping trip and we bought what we needed. The place we go to has good prices and good quality goods. We were satisfied with the products that we bought as always. The only problem was that the store was packed with people when we went. We had to wait in line at the cashier to pay for our stuff.
