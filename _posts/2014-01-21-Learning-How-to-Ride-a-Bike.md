###Topic

I remember learning how to ride a bike when I was a kid. My first bike had training wheels on it. They helped me not to fall. Then one day, I wanted to learn how to ride a bike without the training wheels. My dad helped me learn how to do that. He helped me keep my balance on the bike. It wasn't easy at first, but I eventually got the hang of it. I still remember that moment when I rode my bike on my own for the first time. It felt really good. Looking back, I think every kid in the neighborhood learned how to ride a bike just like I did.
