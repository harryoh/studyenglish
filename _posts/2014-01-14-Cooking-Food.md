###Topic

I'm not the best cook out there, but I know how to cook to some degree. Now, one of the most typical things I cook is instant noodles called ramyun. Now, what you basically do is: you boil two or three cups of water in a pot. And then, you put the soup base in. And when the water boils, you put in the noodles. You can add chopped-up green onions or an egg. You cook it for two or three more minutes until the noodles are fully cooked. Ramyun is one of the most typical snack foods Koreans would cook. It is cheap and there are various flavors.
