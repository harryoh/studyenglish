###Topic

There is a swimming pool near my house. It's actually part of a large fitness center. It's an indoor swimming pool that's 25 meters long. The deepest part of the swimming pool is two meters deep. There are swimming lessons going on all day. But there are times when you can swim freely. I normally go swimming in the evening after I get off work. I used to take lessons in the past, but now, I just swim on my own. I do about 10 laps whenever I go. I think swimming is a great sport because you can get plenty of exercise. You can become more flexible as well. It feels great after a good swim.
