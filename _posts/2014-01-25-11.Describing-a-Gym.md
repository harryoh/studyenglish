###Topic

I go to a small gym near my house. It's not that big or fancy, but it has everything I need for my workout. On one side, there is equipment for cardio exercise. There are treadmills, stationary bikes, and stepping machines. There is a TV screen on each machine that people can watch while they work out. On the other side, there is weight-lifting equipment. There are weight machines and free weights such as barbells and dumbbells. That's what the main workout area looks like. There's also a separate studio area for yoga and aerobics lessons. There's always loud music on at the gym.

**My body was aching all over.**  
온몸이 뻐근해.

A : What's wrong? You look uncomfortable.  
B : I worked out yesterday.  
A : Oh, I see. You started to work out again?  
B : Yes, it's been a while since I worked out. My body was aching all over.  

A : 왜 그래? 어디 불편해 보인다.  
B : 어제 운동을 했거든.  
A : 그렇구나. 다시 운동하기 시작한 거야?  
B : 응, 운도한지 꽤 됐어. 온몸이 뻐근하네.
