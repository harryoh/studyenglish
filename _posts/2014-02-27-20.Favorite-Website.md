###Topic

Without a doubt, one of my favorite websites would have to be Facebook. It is the most popular social networking service in the world. The last time I checked, it had over 1.1 billion users worldwide. Facebook helps me to keep in touch with friends and family members even if they are miles away. I can see what my friends are up to by looking through their pictures. I also leave comments on their pictures, postings, or video clips. I make status updates a couple of times a week myself. Also, because each Facebook page has tons of information about a person, it's useful in getting to know someone for the first time.

###Expression‍ of the day

**I read your posting on Facebook.**  
페이스북에 글 올린 거 봤어. 

A : I'm going to be away all weekend.

A : 주말 내내 나 여기 없어.  
B : 알아. 페이스북에 글 올린 거 봤어.  
A : 아, 그래?  
B : 언제 돌아올 거니?
