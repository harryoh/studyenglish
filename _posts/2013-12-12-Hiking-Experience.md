###Topic

My family and I recently went on a hike to a mountain called Bukhansan. We wanted to go for a hike, but we didn't want to go too far, so that was the perfect place.There were several hiking trails at Bukhansan. We picked a trail that wasn't too tough. We started hiking around 10 a.m. and reached the mountain top two hours later. The view of the city from the peak was fantastic and the air was really fresh. After getting a short rest, we came back down to where we started. We were all quite hungry. so we grabbed some lunch on our way back.
