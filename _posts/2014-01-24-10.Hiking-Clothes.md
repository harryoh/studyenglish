###Topic

I normally wear gym clothes when I go hiking. Usually, this consists of a sweatshirt and sweat pants. Sometimes, I also wear a waterproof jacket on top. I know other people who actually buy special clothing for hiking, but gym clothes are fine for me. However, there is one thing that I always remember. Wearing proper shoes is very important when you go hiking. Good shoes protect your feet and help you not slip. So, I always make sure to wear good hiking shoes. As for food, I normally take light snacks when I go to the mountains. I also take plenty of water so that I don't get dehydrated.
