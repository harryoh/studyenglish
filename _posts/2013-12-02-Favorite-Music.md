###Topic

I 'm not that picky with music. I guess I listen to different types of music depending on the situation. Sometimes, I like listening to soft and quiet music. I guess ballads or classical music would be good examples. These types of songs help me relax. However, there are times when I'm in the mood for up-beat music. PSY's Gangnam Style could be a good example. Fast songs keep my spirits up when I'm working out. Plus, they keep me awake when I'm driving. There are many boy and girl groups in Korea. Many of their songs are fast and up-beat actually.
