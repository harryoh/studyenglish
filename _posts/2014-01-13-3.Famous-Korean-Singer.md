###Topic

PSY is the most famous Korean musician worldwide. He became famous overseas through his song Gangnam Style in 2012. His music video went viral on YouTube. It got more than 1.8 billion hits so far. However, PSY has been a well-known singer in Korea long before Gangnam Style. He has more than a dozen hit songs. Every Korean knows at least one of his songs. He is well-known for his live concerts and wild stage performances. Plus, PSY has a very down-to-earth personality, and many people like him for that reason. As a Korean, I feel proud that there is a Korean singer like PSY. I hope he becomes bigger on the world stage in the future.
