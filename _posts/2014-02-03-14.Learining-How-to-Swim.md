###Topic

I first learned how to swim when I was young. I was first a little scared of the water as a kid, but I got used to it as I grew a little older. At first, I think I just taught myself how to swim. Later on, I took swimming lessons. The swimming instructor taught us very well. I learned the strokes one by one.  I first learned the freestyle and the breaststroke. After that, I learned the backstroke. Unfortunately, I never made it to the butterfly, which is probably the hardest. Overall, I am not the best swimmer, but I'm glad I know how to swim.
